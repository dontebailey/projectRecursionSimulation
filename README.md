# projectRecursionSimulation
This repository illustrates how we can simulate (imitate) recursion using stacks and loops.

In src/net/datastructures, Main contains methods to run a maze game recursively and with while and a method for finding n! recursively.

Another class Fibonnaci lets you find the nth Fibonacci number in a couple of ways.

The class FactorialSimulation simulates the recursive calls using a stack and while loop for the factorial.
